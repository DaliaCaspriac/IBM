Take the first exercise from above and make the class that holds the person
to be an abstract one. Add two abstract methods: getBirthDate() and selfDescribe().
 Create at least two other persons having different nationalities,
 and for each the selfDescribe() method should return a short description of that person
 in his own language, including his / her age. Test everything in a main method.
