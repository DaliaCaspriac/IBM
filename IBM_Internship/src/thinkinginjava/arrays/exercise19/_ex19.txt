Exercise 19:   (2) Create a class with an int field that’s initialized
 from a constructor argument. Create two arrays of these objects,
  using identical initialization values for each array,
  and show that Arrays.equals( ) says that they are unequal.
  Add an equals( ) method to your class to fix the problem.
