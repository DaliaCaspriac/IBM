Exercise 4: (3) Create a generator class that produces character names (as String objects)
 from your favorite movie (you can use Snow White or Star Wars as a fallback)
each time you call next( ), and loops around to the beginning of the character list
when it runs out of names. Use this generator to fill an array,
an ArrayList, a LinkedList, a HashSet, a LinkedHashSet, and a TreeSet, then print each container.
