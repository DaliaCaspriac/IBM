Exercise 17: (2) Take the Gerbil class in Exercise 1 and put it into a Map instead,
associating each Gerbilâ€™s name (e.g. "Fuzzy" or "Spot") as a String (the key)
for each Gerbil (the value) you put in the table.
 Get an Iterator for the keySet( ) and use it to move through the Map,
looking up the Gerbil for each key and printing out the key and telling the Gerbil to hop( ).
